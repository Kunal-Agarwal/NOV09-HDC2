Installing Oracle Database 11g Release 2
Step 1: Install Oracle Dependencies

We use “oracle-rdbms-server-11gR2-preinstall” package offered by “Oracle Public Yum” repository. The Oracle public yum repository provides a free and easiest way to install all the latest Oracle Linux dependencies automatically. To setup yum repository, follow the instructions provided below.

Use “wget” command to Download appropriate yum configuration file under /etc/yum.repos.d/ directory as root user.

RHEL/CentOs 6.x

# cd /etc/yum.repos.d
# wget https://public-yum.oracle.com/public-yum-ol6.repo
RHEL/CentOs 5.x

# cd /etc/yum.repos.d
# wget https://public-yum.oracle.com/public-yum-el5.repo
RHEL/CentOs 4.x

# cd /etc/yum.repos.d
# wget https://public-yum.oracle.com/public-yum-el4.repo
Now perform the following “yum” command to install all the necessary prerequisites automatically.

[root@oracle]# yum install oracle-rdbms-server-11gR2-preinstall

 
While importing GPG key, you might get “GPG key retrieval failed” error as shown below. Here, you need to import proper GPG key for your OS release.

Retrieving key from file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-oracle
GPG key retrieval failed: [Errno 14] Could not open/read file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-oracle
Download and verify the appropriate Oracle Linux GPG Key that best matches your RHEL/CentOS compatible OS release.

RHEL/CentOs 6.x

# wget https://public-yum.oracle.com/RPM-GPG-KEY-oracle-ol6 -O /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-oracle
RHEL/CentOs 5.x

# wget https://public-yum.oracle.com/RPM-GPG-KEY-oracle-el5 -O /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-oracle
RHEL/CentOs 4.x

# wget https://public-yum.oracle.com/RPM-GPG-KEY-oracle-el4 -O /usr/share/rhn/RPM-GPG-KEY-oracle
Step 2: Setting Hostname

Open the “/etc/sysconfig/network” file and modify the HOSTNAME to match your FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name) host name.

[root@oracle]# vi /etc/sysconfig/network
HOSTNAME=oracle.tecmint.com
Open “/etc/hosts” file and add fully qualified hostname for the server.

[root@oracle]# vi /etc/hosts
192.168.246.128		oracle.tecmint.com		oracle
Now you need to restart networking on the server to make sure that changes will be persistent on reboot.

[root@oracle]# /etc/init.d/network restart
Step 3: Oracle User Settings

Set the password for the “oracle” user.

[root@oracle]# passwd oracle
Changing password for user oracle.
New password:
BAD PASSWORD: it is based on a dictionary word
Retype new password:
passwd: all authentication tokens updated successfully.
Add the entry to file “/etc/security/limits.d/90-nproc.conf” as described below.

[root@oracle]# vi /etc/security/limits.d/90-nproc.conf
# Default limit for number of user's processes to prevent
# accidental fork bombs.
# See rhbz #432903 for reasoning.
*          soft    nproc     1024
# To this
* - nproc 16384
Set SELinux to “permissive” mode by editing the file “/etc/selinux/config“.

[root@oracle]# vi /etc/selinux/config
SELINUX=permissive
Once you’ve made change, don’t forger to restart the server to reflect new changes.

[root@oracle]# reboot
Login as Oracle user and open file “.bash_profile“, which is available on oracle user’s home directory, make an entries as described below. Make sure you set correct hostname to “ORACLE_HOSTNAME=oracle.tecmint.com“.

[root@oracle]# su oracle
[oracle@oracle ~]$ vi .bash_profile
# Oracle Settings
TMP=/tmp; export TMP
TMPDIR=$TMP; export TMPDIR
ORACLE_HOSTNAME=oracle.tecmint.com; export ORACLE_HOSTNAME
ORACLE_UNQNAME=DB11G; export ORACLE_UNQNAME
ORACLE_BASE=/u01/app/oracle; export ORACLE_BASE
ORACLE_HOME=$ORACLE_BASE/product/11.2.0/dbhome_1; export ORACLE_HOME
ORACLE_SID=DB11G; export ORACLE_SID
PATH=/usr/sbin:$PATH; export PATH
PATH=$ORACLE_HOME/bin:$PATH; export PATH
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$ORACLE_HOME/lib:/lib:/usr/lib; export LD_LIBRARY_PATH
CLASSPATH=$ORACLE_HOME/jlib:$ORACLE_HOME/rdbms/jlib; export CLASSPATH export PATH
Switch to root user and issue the following command to allow Oracle user to access X Server.

[root@oracle]# xhost +
Create the directories and set the appropriate permissions in which the Oracle software will be installed.

[root@oracle]# mkdir -p /u01/app/oracle/product/11.2.0/dbhome_1
[root@oracle]# chown -R oracle:oinstall /u01
[root@oracle]# chmod -R 775 /u01
Step 4: Downloading Oracle Software

Sign-up and Download the Oracle software using the following link.

Oracle Database 11g Release 2
Download Oracle 11g Release 2
Download Oracle 11g Release 2
The Oracle package contains 2 zip files which you must first accept the license agreement before downloading. I’ve given the files names for you reference, please download these files for your system architecture somewhere under “/home/oracle/“.

Step 5: Oracle Installation

Now let’s start Oracle installation. First of all need to switch as ‘oracle’ user to install database.

[oracle@oracle ~]$ su oracle
Extract compressed Oracle database source files to the same directory “/home/oracle/“.

[oracle@oracle ~]$ unzip linux_11gR2_database_1of2.zip
[oracle@oracle ~]$ unzip linux_11gR2_database_2of2.zip
Post unzip source file, directory called database will be created, go to inside the directory and execute below script to start Oracle database installation process.

[oracle@oracle database]$ cd database
[oracle@oracle database]$ ./runInstaller
1. RunInstaller will call Oracle Universal Installer (OUI), wherein look and feel & steps are the same across all the operating system.

Now you can start using Oracle. I highly recommend you to follow the Oracle Documentation for more help. There are number of client applications out there which can help you, like the command line tool called Oracle Instant Client and the Oracle SQL Developer UI program.

This is end of the Oracle Database Software Installation. In our upcoming article we will be covering how to create database using DBCA and how to Start-up and Shutdown Oracle Database. Please stay tuned…!!!

@Harsh,

Free up some space and see, I think Oracle needs more space for installation..

Hello Everyone.

Good day.

I am new to Oracle and I am on the way of installing Oracle Database 12C. I would like just like to know if the files that I have download [linuxamd64_12c_database_1of2.zip and linuxamd64_12c_database_2of2.zip ] can be also installed in the Linux Server RHEL 6.7 just all using all the terminal? Because what I saw in the internet is that they do it in the terminal and then after some configurations, there will be a GUI for to continue the installation.. With my case, I am just connecting to server located remotely using ssh..

Please advise.

Thanks in advance for the help
